\begin{cvparagraph}
    My research has focused on developing reliable theoretical/computational models to investigate the role of stochastic fluctuations in protein-DNA complexes. I've studied this by analyzing atomistic long timescale macromolecular simulations and performing unsupervised learning via Markov State Models.
